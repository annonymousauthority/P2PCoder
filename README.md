# P2PCODER PLATFORM

A p2p code learning platform that connects developers to a single code editor over the internet. They can write and edit code, and communicate via audio and video streaming.

The goal of the project is to utilize Nextjs and technologies to build this project by newbies. The project has a mid-level degree of complexity, so would be broken down into difficulty levels throughout the 8 weeks.

This document is to help developers understand the platform and the development requirements of the project.
The document will be updated from time to time to meet project expectations and standards.
